        <h3>biography</h3>
        <p>Rob Brown is a visual and sound artist who
        lives in Santa Ana, California. He was born in 1981
        in Joplin, Missouri and grew up in Reno, Nevada.
        His practice includes drawing, printmaking, painting
        and sound installation. His current work deals with ideas
        of systems, structure, logic and perception. He employs
        processed and synthesized sounds alongside prints and drawings.
        These works are realized through a set of self-defined parameters
        which come from personal research and interests.</p>

        <p>His interests span from experimental sound synthesis
        and generative sequencing to cognitive science and both
        colloquial/formal ideas of logic. His aim is to create an
        opportunity for the viewer to enter a more active viewing
        and listening space. He believes there is value in the act
        of slowing down and spending time with something in a society
        that is increasingly surrounded and bombarded with stimuli designed
        to be digested in split seconds.</p>

        <p>He received his AAA in Animation Art and Design from the
        Seattle Art Institute in 2002 and his BFA in painting and drawing
        from the University of Nevada, Reno in 2008. In spring of 2013
        he receieved his MFA in studio art from California State University,
        Long Beach. He has exhibited his work nationally and abroad.</p>
