            <p>A suite of 16 panels with audio electronics
            mounted behind them utilizing the combination and
            interaction of different methods of logic and rules
            based systems. These concepts of logic and systems
            are drawn from various sources such as complex modern
            financial structures, primitive fractals, experimental
            sound processing/sequencing and compression algorithms
            used indigital media. The combination of these
            various structures plays with ideas found in the
            cognitive sciences that have long interested me,
            pattern seeking and phenomenology especially.</p>
            <p>Taking components from these various forms of logic
            and playing with them is both my attempt to investigate
            what components of these structures interests me and to
            allow space for them to transform, interfere and re-inform
            one another through their translation into components of
            drawings and sound pieces.</p>
